  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Madeliene, currently soaking up all things Full Stack Software Engineering at Academy XI, 
  from the beautiful Sunshine Coast, QLD. Before this, I completed an Undergraduate Degree in Programming with Coder Academy.
   I'm eagerly eyeing 2024 to kickstart my career, where I plan to focus on building websites for small to 
   medium businesses. There's something special about helping a small business find its feet online, 
   and I can't wait to be a part of that journey for many entrepreneurs. But it's not all coding in my world; 
   I love to spend my downtime outdoors, usually with my two little ones in tow. Whether it/'s a day at the beach 
   or a bushwalk exploring our local area, we're always up for a little adventure.
  Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
